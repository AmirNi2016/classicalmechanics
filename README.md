classicalmechanics notes compilation

   Personal study notes on Lagrangians, and Hamiltonians (Reading of Goldstein, ... ).
   These are currently part of the posted gabook.pdf, but I've pulled them into this collection because
   gabook is too big.

   There are also some classical mechanics notes and problems from auditing a small subset of
   'Advanced Classical Mechanics', taught by Prof. Erich Poppitz.
   I only ended up doing the first problem set from that course, although I still indend to go back and
   revisit the rest to ensure I've got these basics down.
